# Recruitment Policy

### General Meeting Consented on 12/1/2021
#### Term: 1 year (expires 12/1/2022)

## (1) Revision to Meetings 
 - We will sometimes invite guest speakers at meetings such as scientists, community activists, etc.
 - We will try to make meetings as short and efficient as possible. Suggested meeting length is no longer than 90 minutes.
 - We will meet in person more often.
 - We will sometimes include presentations about successful climate actions and how they were accomplished in general meetings.
 - Working group reports to the general meeting will include what the working group did well since the last general meeting, what the working group could’ve done better since the last general meeting, and what the working group wants to improve on before the next general meeting. 

## (2) Revision of Onboarding Process
 - The onboarding person will follow up with new members by asking: What are your expectations for XR and how did the meeting(s) meet your expectations? If we start getting more members than the onboarding person can manage, we will move to a buddy system where assigned XR members are partnered with new members.
 - Instructions to Existing Working Groups 
 - We will encourage the working groups to prioritize the idea of distributing work to prevent burnout. People in the group can point out if someone is overworked, etc. to also prevent burnout. 
 - We will encourage the actions working group to adopt action goals that aid in recruitment of desired groups such as artists, direct action-oriented people, diverse communities, and specific other organizations.
 - Working groups are encouraged to spend at least 10 minutes per regular meeting discussing what went well, what could’ve been better, and what should be improved before the next regular working group meeting.

## (3) Revision of How We Use Technology 
 - We affirm that we have serious usability problems with Keybase. Furthermore, we affirm that it is as of now impossible to become a member of XR Houston by just using the website alone. Therefore, we will begin another sociocratic policy creation process centered around trying to solve these problems.

## (4) Revision of How We Publicize Events 
 - We will have the Zoom link for the general meeting public on the website to decrease pain points for getting into a first XR meeting.
 - We will use social media and action network to publicize outward facing events including all mentioned elsewhere in this document.

## (5) Addition of Membership Recruitment Working Group 
 - We will have a working group for recruitment called the Membership Recruitment Working Group. 
 - The Membership Recruitment Working Group would decide what they want their domain to be and propose that domain to a general meeting for approval. (A domain in sociocracy defines a working group’s area of responsibility for policy making and operational activities. A working group is granted the mandate to work toward their defined aim; in exchange, we entrust them with the authority that is required to perform the tasks that come with those aims.) 
 - Suggested priorities of this working group would include organizing social events as well as setting realistic membership numbers, timelines, budgets, and diversity goals. 

## (6) More Fun Activities 
 - We will have movie nights and discuss after. We will watch documentaries about climate change in particular, in person or online. We will make sure to have snacks to draw people.
 - We will have day trips to nature areas, front line communities, etc for a more interactive and immersive experience and more fun events. 
 - We will sponsor an outward facing book club for The Uninhabitable Earth and publicize it.
 - We will hold special meetings where we discuss successful climate actions of the past.

## (7) Collaboration with other groups
 - We will collaborate more with other climate groups. We will get volunteer XR members to be representatives of XR to target groups we want to collaborate with.
 - Outreach to artists, actors 
 - We will have more build-outs, banners to draw artists. We will attend Silver Street Studios 2nd Friday to meet, network with local artists. We will put up a flier on bulletin boards on nearby art schools on a nicely designed leaflet with a phone number and email address. We will also do this for drama departments to target actors for a similar reason.
